Initial tests done using:
asetup AthGeneration,21.6.56
Now moved to 21.6.59 which includes my updated Athena filters.

If doing Gridpack generation you MUST run on an slc6 node/container.

Need to have this during job running:
JOBOPTSEARCHPATH=$JOBOPTSEARCHPATH:/afs/cern.ch/work/k/kpachal/PhaseIITrack/Signals/Generation/ControlFiles/
